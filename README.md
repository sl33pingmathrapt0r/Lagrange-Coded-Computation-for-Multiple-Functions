# Lagrange-Coded-Computation-for-Multiple-Functions

We consider the problem of evaluating arbitrary multivariate polynomials over several massive datasets in a distributed computing system. We focus on the general case when each multivariate polynomial is evaluated over its dataset and propose a generalization of the Lagrange Coded Computing framework (Yu et al. 2019) to provide robustness against stragglers and malicious workers. We validate our scheme via numerical experiments.
